rc Exif Meta, Version: 5.11

First-time Installation & Configuration
=======================================

*** See below for subsequent installations / updating.

-  Unzip the downloaded plugin into a folder of your choosing (I recommend putting in "Documents/FromOthers/RobCole", but can go anywhere,
   *except* do NOT put in "Program Files" folder or in with operating system files...), and remember its location for step 4.
   (plugin is used in place and therefore must not be moved after installation)
-  Open Lightroom's Plugin Manager (on the File Menu).
-  Click the 'Add' Button (lower left).
-  Use the mouse to select the folder whose name ends with '.lrplugin' (including the dot, but not the apostrophes),
   which is *inside* the folder where the plugin was unzipped in step 1.
   *** Make sure you are *not* selecting the plugin's parent folder which has '(lrplugin)' in the name - instead, double-click it to get inside, *then* select the proper folder.
   *** If you inadvertently double-click the .lrplugin folder, then click the "Back" button to go back.
   *** Mac users: the correct folder to select will probably appear as a "plugin", instead of a folder proper.
-  Click the 'Select Folder' button (or something to that effect, e.g. correct button may also be labeled 'OK').
   If you have the wrong folder selected, Lr will lodge a complaint such as: "An error occurred while attempting to load this plug-in". If that happens, try it again.
-  Review the information presented by the plugin manager, and edit settings if necessary or desirable.
-  Click 'Done'.
